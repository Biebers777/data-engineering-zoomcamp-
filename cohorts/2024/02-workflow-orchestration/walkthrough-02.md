### GCP VM and Mage-ai

This is to run *local* mage on GCP VM instead of locally on WSL+Ubuntu. 

drag+drop `env.` and `nyc-rides-ella-85c8b8d18b10.json` to `cohorts/2024/02-workflow-orchestration` as these files were not committed to github.

TODO Need to research how to store these safely in GCP, think there's a SECRETS settings to configure

docker volume create --name hmwk02_volume -d local 
docker network create pg-network   

TODO check this! The entrypoint is still at `http://localhost:6789/`; with the above volume and network created.  (?)

### Deploying Mage to GCP

This is for [chapter 7 ðŸ¤–-deployment](../../../02-workflow-orchestration/README.md/#227---ðŸ¤–-deployment-optional)

Notes moved. See [module's README](../../../02-workflow-orchestration/README.md), under chapter 7 linked above.

Results: can provision VM and deploy mage via Terraform. But pipeline fails, at Data Exporter blocks, bacause the contents are not from docker-compose.yaml. 

```bash
root@localhost:/home/src# ls -la
total 0
```

TODO Research:
- 
- there is no buckets, but SQL this time.
- how do I hook into the postgres?
- how do I hook into the BigQuery?
- default_repo folder in Mage UI not appearing in  mave-vm SSH, presumably it would be persistent in `volume: hmwk02_volume`?
- need to try hooking into postgres DB from jupyter with 
  - connection string: `nyc-rides-ella:asia-southeast1:mage-data-vm-db-instance`

[mage-data-vm-db-instance](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances/mage-data-vm-db-instance/overview?project=nyc-rides-ella)

TODO
If the service we just edited with the Roles are not showing up, it's because we need to redownload and sftp it into the VM storage? 
Ans: Not according to GCP docs. Need to locate the source again.

No containers running.
```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES

### GCP VM and Mage-ai

This is to run *local* mage on GCP VM instead of locally on WSL+Ubuntu. 

drag+drop `env.` and `nyc-rides-ella-85c8b8d18b10.json` to `cohorts/2024/02-workflow-orchestration` as these files were not committed to github.

TODO Need to research how to store these safely in GCP, think there's a SECRETS settings to configure

docker volume create --name hmwk02_volume -d local 
docker network create pg-network   

TODO check this! The entrypoint is still at `http://localhost:6789/`; with the above volume and network created.  (?)

### Deploying Mage to GCP

This is for [chapter 7 ðŸ¤–-deployment](../../../02-workflow-orchestration/README.md/#227---ðŸ¤–-deployment-optional)

Notes moved. See [module's README](../../../02-workflow-orchestration/README.md), under chapter 7 linked above.

TODO
If the service we just edited with the Roles are not showing up, it's because we need to redownload and sftp it into the VM storage.

No containers running.
```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

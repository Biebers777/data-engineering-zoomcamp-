# BingAI QnA

Sharing this as others are also trying to make postgres DB persistent so we need not reingest or reinput login data once we have the `docker-compose.yaml` file in a good state.

The result of this experiment is the working [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml)

## Question: persist data in pgadmin

Qn: Each time I run `docker compose up` on this docker-compose.yaml file, I have to re-input the servername, database name, table name, user and password; is there a way for me to persist these data and not have to input them into pgadmin?

```yaml
services:
  pgdatabase:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=root
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
      - POSTGRES_DB=ny_taxi
    volumes:
      - "dtc_postgres_volume_local:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw"
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=root
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
volumes:
  dtc_postgres_volume_local:
    external: true
```

### Bing answer
Yes, you can persist the data by using environment variables in your `docker-compose.yaml` file. You can define the values of the environment variables in a separate file and then reference that file in your `docker-compose.yaml` file using the `env_file` parameter.

Here's an example of how to use environment variables to persist your database credentials:

```yaml
services:
  pgdatabase:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
    volumes:
      - "dtc_postgres_volume_local:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw"
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=root
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
volumes:
  dtc_postgres_volume_local:
    external: true
env_file:
  - ./database.env
```

In this example, the `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` environment variables are defined in a separate file called `database.env`. You can create this file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file and define the values of the environment variables like this:

```
POSTGRES_USER=root
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
POSTGRES_DB=ny_taxi
```

When you run `docker-compose up`, the values of the environment variables will be loaded from the `database.env` file and used to start the containers.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Question:  What about the server name in Register Server?

### Bing answer
To persist the server name in pgAdmin, you can create a new server group and add the server to that group. Here's how:

1. In pgAdmin, right-click on the "Servers" node in the tree view and select "Create" > "Server Group".
2. Enter a name for the new server group and click "OK".
3. Right-click on the new server group and select "Create" > "Server".
4. In the "General" tab, enter a name for the server and the hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server.
5. In the "Connection" tab, enter the database name, username, and password for the PostgreSQL server.
6. Click "Save" to save the server settings.

Once you've added the server to the new server group, it will be persisted in pgAdmin and you won't need to enter the server name again.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Question: information about (4)


QN: How do I find out information about 4. In the “General” tab, enter a name for the server and the hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server ?

This is a local docker container.

### Bing answer
If you're running PostgreSQL in a Docker container, you can use the container name or ID as the hostname when connecting to the server. By default, Docker creates a DNS entry for each container using the container name as the hostname. You can use this hostname to connect to the PostgreSQL server from other containers or from the host machine.
To find the hostname of your PostgreSQL container, you can use the following command:

docker inspect <container_name_or_id> | grep IPAddress

This will return the IP address of the container, which you can use as the hostname when connecting to the PostgreSQL server.
Alternatively, you can use the container name as the hostname when connecting to the server. By default, Docker assigns a unique name to each container based on a randomly generated adjective and a noun. You can use this name to connect to the PostgreSQL server from other containers or from the host machine.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

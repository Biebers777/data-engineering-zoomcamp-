## Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in AWS with Terraform.

In your EC2 instance on AWS install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM.

Modify the files (`main.tf`, `variable.tf`, and `README.md` for documentation practice) as necessary to create a S3 bucket and Redshift Dataset.

_Hint_ ssh to EC2?


**Bonus** Try to do the exercise with CloudFormation instead of Terraform.

>**Warning** I left an EC2 instance on and ended up in poverty.

## Question 1. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

What is the equivalent steps you have to do in the case of CloudFormation.

How do Terraform and AWS CloudFormation differ in terms of functionality, capabilities, and usage?

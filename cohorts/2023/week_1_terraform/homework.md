## Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in AWS with Terraform.

In your EC2 instance on AWS install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM.

Modify the files as necessary to create a S3 bucket and Redshift Dataset.

_Hint_ ssh to EC2?
**Bonus** Try to do the exercise with CloudFormation instead of Terraform.

## Question 1. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

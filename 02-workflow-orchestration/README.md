# Week 2: Workflow Orchestration

Welcome to Week 2 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp! üöÄüò§ This week, we'll be covering workflow orchestration with Mage.

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. ‚ú®

This week, you'll learn how to use the Mage platform to author and share _magical_ data pipelines. This will all be covered in the course, but if you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out our docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview).

### 2.2.2 - üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Intro to Mage

In this section, we'll introduce the Mage platform. We'll cover what makes Mage different from other orchestrators, the fundamental concepts behind Mage, and how to get started. To cap it off, we'll spin Mage up via Docker üê≥ and run a simple pipeline.

### --- EllaNotes ---

In this demo, Matt showed how to connect to Mage and see the default `example-pipeline`. Make sure you have setup the GCP service accounts and project in GCP.

Also see [README-mage](README-mage.md) for guides from Matt Palmer. [Original repo](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp) has a `solution` branch. Handy to copy over the code if we forgot to rename pipelines or data blocks.

> [!INFO]
>
>![](./images/mage-update-notice.png)
>
>If you see that mage-ai has an update like in the picture above, after completing your work and you have exited, just do a `docker pull mageai/mageai:latest` to update mage-ai image and then re`build` docker, or rerun the `up` again for the next session.

> [!CAUTION]
>
>Yet another reminder: ***DO NOT COPY CODE BLINDLY!*** 
>
>EACH TIME you do copy+paste, ask yourself
>1. are you violating DRY principle? 
>1. should I put this code block in a function for re-use?
>1. is this a SECRET?! should I have this in an .env? 
>1. is this info supposed to be in .gitignore, too?
>1. is this universal code, or specific to an environment and OS configs, meaning I need to edit it to suit mine?

Recall that (in video 1.3.2 Terraform Basics), we created `terraform-runner` in module-01 in GCP to run `terraform-init` etc. Go rewatch that if cannot remember.

> Service accounts are programmatically accessed from our code and not meant to be logged into. It is to restrict the activities and permissions this project can do for that service. 
> 
> *It is dangerous to give broad permissions to all GCP services* as **Account Owner** at project level, or any levels.

This `terraform-runner` was created under project-id `terraform-demo` (with gcp unique identifier `tidy-daylight-411205` in mine) selected in the top drop-down.

> We wouldn't give broad Admin access to the 3 services that we do here, generally either. This is just for convenience for this course.

For this module, `nyc-rides-ella` was created as project-name and it has identical project-id of `nyc-rides-ella` (project-id must be unique GCP-wide globally, *let's hope there's no other Ella doing this course in 2024*). To add/remove services to the `taxi-runner` (the one I created for this module-02 Mage lesson), make sure the project is the one selected, then go to `IAM` and `Create Service accounts` or `Edit Principle`. 

And add Service Accounts for the 3 Services we're using,

- BigQuery Admin
- Compute Admin
- Storage Admin

![](./images/terraform-runner-permissions.png)

Then, create a new key as a JSON file to authenticate ourselves so that our code has permissions to access this GCP project and services.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>
>Be sure to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file `env_file:` and `volumes:` sections to suit your environment. 

### 2.2.3 - üêò ETL: API to Postgres

Hooray! Mage is up and running. Now, let's build a _real_ pipeline. In this section, we'll build a simple ETL pipeline that loads data from an API into a Postgres database. Our database will be built using Docker‚Äî it will be running locally, but it's the same as if it were running in the cloud.

### --- EllaNotes ---

#### Assumed knowledge

- brush up on passing return values and OOP principles. We're using a lot of functions and returns to pass from one block to the next in **mage pipelines**.

So, after we have setup mage-ai in 2.2.2, in this chapter, Matt demo the postgres setup and creating a pipeline for our Taxi Dataset that we're using throughout the course.

This is why I again recommend watching ALL videos in a module before doing any coding-along sessions.

Notice how the `docker-compose.yaml` file differs from the module-01's contents. In module-01, we used `postgres` + `pgadmin` services. In module-02, we used `magic` + `postgres` services. We don't need `pgadmin` services anymore, as mage-ai is acting as the interface client we are interacting to our database with. And we're writing all our code in the mage-ai interface called blocks instead of in jupyter notebook cells.

The following string and other information like the `taxi_dtypes` can be copied from the [`solution` branch](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp/blob/solutions/magic-zoomcamp/data_loaders/load_nyc_taxi_data.py)

```
URL="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz"
```

In chapters 2 (2.2.2) and 3 (2.2.3), we're saving the csv.gz file into a local postgres `mage-ai.db`. Next chapter, we're gonna repeat the steps here but connecting to postgres in the cloud. Google Cloud Storage, to be specific.

### 2.2.4 - ü§ì ETL: API to GCS

Ok, so we've written data _locally_ to a database, but what about the cloud? In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of using Mage to extract, transform, and load data from an API to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). 

We'll cover both writing _partitioned_ and _unpartitioned_ data to GCS and discuss _why_ you might want to do one over the other. Many data teams start with extracting data from a source and writing it to a data lake _before_ loading it to a structured data source, like a database.

### 2.2.5 - üîç ETL: GCS to BigQuery

Now that we've written data to GCS, let's load it into BigQuery. In this section, we'll walk through the process of using Mage to load our data from GCS to BigQuery. This closely mirrors a very common data engineering workflow: loading data from a data lake into a data warehouse.

### --- EllaNotes ---

If you never of the terms `oltp` versus `olap`, I suggest you go research that before completing this lesson. What does it mean for a database to be *relational* or *unstructured*?

Other terms mentioned are `data lake` and `data warehouse`.

Just drag+drop previous data blocks

- load_api_data
- transform_taxi_data

and connect the blocks with the right parent-child hierarchy.

Then add another `data exporter` block, add the bucket_name `mage-zoomcamp-ellacharmed` and object_key `nyc_taxi_data.parquet`, click on `Execute with all upstream blocks` and finally refresh your Buckers page on GCS.

Next we do a partitioned export by date. Makes it easier to query data as dates is a natural conditional usually used.

We also exported our (unpartitioned) data to BigQuery.

Scheduling `pipelines` is done from the `Triggers` tab. If there are dependencies, triggers can also be chained, just like the Pipeline tree.



### 2.2.6 - üë®‚Äçüíª Parameterized Execution

By now you're familiar with building pipelines, but what about adding parameters? In this video, we'll discuss some built-in runtime variables that exist in Mage and show you how to define your own! We'll also cover how to use these variables to parameterize your pipelines. Finally, we'll talk about what it means to *backfill* a pipeline and how to do it in Mage.

- [Mage Runtime Variables](https://docs.mage.ai/getting-started/runtime-variable)

### --- EllaNotes ---

Partial loading of dataset is called `[parameterized]`, for example to partioned into daily subfolders or by location. Try on time_series!

Backfill means to rerun pipeline on newly acquired data for eg missing dates or other data, not loaded/transformed/exported in previous runs. Needs more reading up.

### 2.2.7 - ü§ñ Deployment (Optional)

In this section, we'll cover deploying Mage using Terraform and Google Cloud. This section is optional‚Äî it's not *necessary* to learn Mage, but it might be helpful if you're interested in creating a fully deployed project. If you're using Mage in your final project, you'll need to deploy it to the cloud.

### 2.2.8 - üóíÔ∏è Homework 

We've prepared a short exercise to test you on what you've learned this week. You can find the homework [here](../cohorts/2024/02-workflow-orchestration/homework.md). This follows closely from the contents of the course and shouldn't take more than an hour or two to complete. üòÑ

### --- EllaNotes ---

Done on Sun, setup Trigger to schedule daily run at 5am UTC. Missed it by 2 hours 3pm SGT / 7am UTC, so have to check back in next day.


### 2.2.9 - üë£ Next Steps

the selection should be performed along the columns.

The action object is then passed to the execute_action function, which is also imported from the mage_ai library. This function takes in the action object and the DataFrame and executes the specified action. In this case, the execute_action function will select all the columns from the DataFrame and return the transformed DataFrame.

Finally, the function returns the transformed DataFrame. This script can be used as part of a larger data pipeline, where it will be responsible for transforming the data before it is exported to another source.

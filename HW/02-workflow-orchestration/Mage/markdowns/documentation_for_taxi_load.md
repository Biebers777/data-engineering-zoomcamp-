# Python Script Documentation

## Introduction
The python script is used to load data from a specific data source. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the mage_ai library, specifically the data_preparation module. The script is written in Python and uses the pandas library for data manipulation.

## Libraries
The script imports the pandas library as pd. This library is used for data manipulation and analysis. It is a popular library for working with tabular data.

## Global Variables
The script checks for the existence of two global variables, 'data_loader' and 'test'. If these variables do not exist, they are imported from the mage_ai library. This ensures that the script can be used independently or as part of the mage_ai library.

## Data Types
The script defines a dictionary called 'taxi_dtypes' which contains the data types for each column in the dataset. This is used when loading the data to ensure that the correct data types are assigned to each column.

## Data Loader Decorator
The script uses the 'data_loader' decorator from the mage_ai library. This decorator is used to mark the function as a data loader, which means it can be used to load data from a specific data source. The decorator also ensures that the function returns a

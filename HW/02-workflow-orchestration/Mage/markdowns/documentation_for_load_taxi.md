# Python Script Documentation: Loading Data from API

This python script is used to load data from a specific data source, specifically an API. It is designed to be used as a template for loading data from an API, making it easily adaptable for different data sources.

## Importing Libraries
The first few lines of the script import necessary libraries for the data loading process. These include the `io` library for handling input/output operations, the `pandas` library for data manipulation and analysis, and the `requests` library for making HTTP requests to the API.

## Checking for Existing Functions
The next few lines of the script check if the `data_loader` and `test` functions are already defined in the global scope. If they are not, they are imported from the `mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators` module. These functions are used for data loading and testing purposes, respectively.

## Defining the Data Loader Function
The `load_data_from_api` function is the main function of the script and is decorated with the `@data_loader` decorator. This decorator is used to register the function as a data loader, making it accessible for use in other parts of the code.

The function takes in `*args` and `**kwargs` as parameters,

# Week 2: Workflow Orchestration

Welcome to Week 2 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp! üöÄüò§ This week, we'll be covering workflow orchestration with Mage.

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. ‚ú®

In this module, you'll learn how to use the Mage platform to author and share _magical_ data pipelines. This will all be covered in the course, but if you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out our docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview). 

You can find this week's videos and resources in the [Course Resources](https://github.com/mattppal/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/matt/mage/week_2_workflow_orchestration#-course-resources) section below. 

The first two videos are more conceptual and introductory. In the second, we'll dive into configuring Mage from our [Getting Started Repo](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp).

Here's a rough course syllabus:

2.2.1 - üìØ Intro to Orchestration
* An overview of orchestration as a concept, and how it fits into the data engineering landscape.

2.2.2 - üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Intro to Mage
* An overview of Mage as a platform, and how it fits into the data engineering landscape.

2.2.3 - üêò ETL: API to Postgres
* Writing an ETL pipeline to load data from an API into a Postgres database.

2.2.4 - ü§ì ETL: API to GCS
* Writing an ETL pipeline to load data from an API into GCS.

2.2.5 - üîç ETL: GCS to BigQuery
* Writing an ETL pipeline to load data from GCS into BigQuery.

2.2.6 - üë®‚Äçüíª Parameterized Execution
* Writing a parameterized pipeline to load data from an API into GCS.

2.2.7 - ü§ñ Deployment (Optional)
* Deploying a pipeline to Google Cloud.

2.2.8 - üß± Advanced Blocks (Optional)
* An overview of advanced blocks, including dynamic blocks, conditional blocks, replica blocks, and callback blocks.

2.2.9 - üóíÔ∏è Homework 
* Homework overview and instructions

2.2.10 - üë£ Next Steps
* wrap up

## üåä Data Lake (GCS)

This course uses Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as a data lake. If you're not familiar with the concept of a data lake, the following may be helpful:

* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RkH-YhBz2apIjYZAxUz2Uks4Pt51-fVWVN9CcH9ckyY/edit?usp=sharing)

This video covers the basics of data lakes and data warehouses, including:
* What is a Data Lake?
* ELT vs. ETL?
* Alternatives to components (S3/HDFS, Redshift, Snowflake etc.)git add .

### ‚úÖ Solutions and Examples

If you're looking for the solutions _or_ completed examples from the course, you can take a look at the `solutions` [branch](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp/blob/solutions) of the course repo.

```bash
git checkout solutions
```

Running `docker compose up` on the solutions branch will start the container with the solutions loaded. _Note: this will overwrite the files in your local repo. Be sure to commit your files to a separate branch if you'd like to save your work._

Navigate to http://localhost:6789 in your browser to see the solutions. Optionally, use [tag sorting](http://localhost:6789/pipelines?group_by=tag) to group solutions by tag.
